# Overview v1.1.1

### CVE-2024-3094 is a critical security vulnerability found in specific versions of xz-utils, a widely used compression tool. This program automates the process of checking your system for the vulnerable versions and provides a prompt to download and install a secure version if necessary.

#### Enhanced Security with Improved Detection Mechanism
- Have enhanced security by querying the installed xz version using the system's package manager, avoiding the execution of a potentially vulnerable binary.

#### Upgrade First Approach
- The program attempts to upgrade xz to the latest available version through the system's package manager before considering downgrading to a safe version. This keeps systems up-to-date with recent xz releases, resorting to the specified stable version only when an upgrade isn't possible.

#### Enhanced OS and Package Manager Support
- Added functionality to detect the operating system and determine the appropriate package manager. Now supports apt-get for Debian-based distributions (including Kali Linux), dnf or yum for Red Hat-based distributions (including CentOS, Fedora, and Rocky Linux), and zypper for OpenSUSE.

#### Updated Stable Version Download URL
- Updated the URL to source the stable version of xz from SourceForge, providing a more direct and reliable source for the download.

#### Installation Process Improvements
- Maintained the compile and install approach but structured the program to integrate better with future enhancements that could leverage native package management for installation where possible.

#### User Interaction for System Reboot
- Added a prompt to reboot the system after successful installation of the stable xz version, ensuring that any changes are properly applied system-wide.

#### Program Usability and Messaging
- Enhanced messaging throughout the program provides clearer feedback to the user about each step's success or failure, including instructions for manual intervention if needed.

## Prerequisites
Before running this program, ensure your system has the following:

- `wget` or `curl` for downloading the source code of xz-utils.
