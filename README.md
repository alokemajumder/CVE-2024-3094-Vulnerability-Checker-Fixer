 # What is CVE-2024-3094

CVE-2024-3094 is a critical security vulnerability discovered in the upstream tarballs of the xz utility, starting with version 5.6.0. This vulnerability involves malicious code that, through complex obfuscations, manipulates the build process of liblzma. 

# XZ Utils is “present in nearly every Linux distribution,

During the build, a prebuilt object file is extracted from a disguised test file within the source code. This file then modifies specific functions in the liblzma code, resulting in a compromised liblzma library. Any software linked against this modified library could intercept and alter data interactions, posing significant security risks​

# CVE-2024-3094 Vulnerability Checker & Fixer

This project contains a simple shell script designed to help users identify and fix installations of xz-utils affected by the CVE-2024-3094 vulnerability. Versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz-utils are known to be vulnerable, and this script aids in detecting them and optionally downgrading to a stable, uncompromised version (5.4.6).
